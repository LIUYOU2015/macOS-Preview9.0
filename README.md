# Make Preview great again

With macOS High Sierra came Preview 10.0, thus taking away our ability to open multiple PDFs in one window (or a single tab, if you will).

This will not stand, man.

## How-to get the old behaviour back

* Copy Preview.app from a Computer still running macOS Sierra, or from a Time Machine backup
* (Alternatively, checkout this repo or download https://github.com/frhd/macOS-Preview9.0/archive/master.zip)
* Move Preview9.app to your User/Applications folder
* Set Preview9.app as default PDF Viewer for all PDFs ([Instructions](http://osxdaily.com/2011/10/31/set-default-pdf-viewer-mac-os-x/))
